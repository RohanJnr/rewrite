A Discord bot for D&D 5th Edition, created for the Tavern Discord server, but available for any server. This is a rewrite of the original Tavern bot using the most recent version of the [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) library.

### What can it do currently?
We've implemented lookups into the D&D 5e System Reference Document and some helpful tabletop utility commands. As a work in progress, several cogs still have to be rewritten, commands need to be fleshed out, and Pythonic style returned to the inner modules.
